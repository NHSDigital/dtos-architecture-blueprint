    documentation="This stage consists of the work required to plan high quality and efficient screening pathways. This might be the creation of a new screening pathway or adjustments to existing pathways e.g. changes to eligibility criteria to increase cost-effectiveness. To plan screening pathways effectively, it must be possible to forecast demand and capacity at an aggregate level and balance the two.
