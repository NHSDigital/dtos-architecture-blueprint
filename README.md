# Service Blueprint Architecture Model

This repository contains the high level architectural model for Digital Transformation of Screening. Its primary concern is the Value Streams and their link with Business Capabilities. Additionally it manages the relationship between Products and lower level Business Capabilities. A lot of this background to this is covered here - https://nhsd-confluence.digital.nhs.uk/display/DTS/Target+Service+Blueprint

## How to Use

Please follow the instructions and guidelines posted here - https://nhsd-confluence.digital.nhs.uk/display/DTS/Archi+Set+Up+for+collaborative+work

## Confluence Page Generation

One of the intentions of this model is for it to drive some of the Confluence content such that they two are kept in synchronisation. The output of this is available here - https://nhsd-confluence.digital.nhs.uk/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=937823228 and here - https://nhsd-confluence.digital.nhs.uk/display/DTS/Products

### Auto-generated content

Associated with this repository is a github action which generates the page contents whenever the model is updated. This should be a seamless task, but in the event that the content needs changing or the model has changed and the output hasn't been reflected in Confluence. The source for that github action can be found here - https://github.com/NHSDigital/dtos-capability-generator
